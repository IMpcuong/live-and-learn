1. `flock` package on RHEL distribution:

```out
NAME
       flock - manage locks from shell scripts

SYNOPSIS
       flock [options] <file|directory> <command> [command args]
       flock [options] <file|directory> -c <command>
       flock [options] <file descriptor number>

DESCRIPTION
       This utility manages flock(2) locks from within shell scripts or the command line.

       The  first and second forms wrap the lock around the executing a command, in a manner similar to su(1) or newgrp(1).  It locks a specified file or
       directory, which is created (assuming appropriate permissions), if it does not already exist.  By default,  if  the  lock  cannot  be  immediately
       acquired, flock waits until the lock is available.

       The third form uses open file by file descriptor number.  See examples how that can be used.
