| Code  | Description                                                                                     |
| ----- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 0     | Successful exit without errors.                                                                 |
| 1     | One or more generic errors encountered upon exit.                                               |
| 2     | Incorrect usage, such as invalid options or missing arguments.                                  |
| 126   | Command found but is not executable.                                                            |
| 127   | Command not found, usually the result of a missing directory in $PATH variable.                 |
| 128+N | Command encountered fatal error (was forcefully terminated manually or from an outside source). |
|       | The N tells us which signal was received (see example below).                                   |
| 130   | Command terminated with signal 2 (SIGINT) (ctrl+c on keyboard ~ 128+2).                         |
| 143   | Command terminated with signal 15 (SIGTERM) (kill command ~ 128+15).                            |
