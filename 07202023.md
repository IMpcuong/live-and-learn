1. Comparison between `cacerts` and `keystore`:

- `cacerts` is a truststore. A trust store is used to authenticate peers.
- A keystore is used to authenticate yourself.

- NOTE:

(1) A truststore is used to authenticate peers. If you're the client, the server is the peer; if you're the server, vice versa.
(2) If you're the server, or if you're the client and the server requests client authentication, you have to authenticate yourself to the peer,
    so you need your own certificate and private key, which are in the keystore.
