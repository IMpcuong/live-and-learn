1. Windows Server commands: [Microsoft Docs cmd](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-server/administration/windows-commands/windows-commands)

- NOTE:

  - How to find the source path for the builtin executable binary/application/.dll:

  ```pwsh
  [pwsh]
  $ where.exe whoami
  C:\Windows\System32\whoami.exe
  C:\Windows\SysWOW64\whoami.exe
  ```

  ```cmd
  [cmd]
  $ where whoami
  C:\Windows\System32\whoami.exe
  C:\Windows\SysWOW64\whoami.exe
  ```

  - `.cpl`: this extension determines the `Control panel applets (items)` file type. Exp: `[ sysdm.cpl, inetcpl.cpl, firewall.cpl, desk.cpl ]`.
  - [Description of Control Panel `.cpl` files](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/topic/description-of-control-panel-cpl-files-4dc809cd-5063-6c6d-3bee-d3f18b2e0176)

- `whoami`: similar with the twins in LinuxOS, used to display user, group and privileges information for the user currently logged on to the local system.
  If used without parameters/options, `whoami` will display the current domain and username.

  **[Syntax]**

  ```cmd
  whoami [/upn | /fqdn | /logonid]

2. `Vim` note:

- Search/move inline:

  - Forward: `f + <first_character_of_word>` -> search next: `;`.
  - Backward: `shift + f + <first_character_of_word>`.

- Duplicate previous action: remember action between 2 `COMMAND MODE` entries.

  - Exp: `COMMAND MODE` -> `INSERT MODE` delete 4 characters -> `COMMAND MODE` -> press `.` in any position -> reproduce: delete 4 characters.

- `COMMAND MODE` -> `VISUAL MODE` (press `v`) -> obliterate the word you want to delete -> press `c` -> will delete all the chosen characters and return to `INSERT MODE`.

- Replace inline: `VISUAL MODE` -> press `:` -> `:'<,'>s/<word>/<replace>/ic` (`i`: inline, `c`: confirm).

- Copy one (or multiple) line(s) to clipboard: `COMMAND MODE` -> `<start>,<end>y *` -> `p` to paste to wherever as you want to.

- Table of some common motions/actions:
