1. `xargs`: using `stdout` as `stdin` for command not allowed stream input.

- Exp1: copy all the files with same extension to destination directory.

  - NOTE: `cp -t` specify destination folder for the `copy` command.

```bash
find ~/Downloads/ -name "*.jpg" | xargs cp -t .
```

- Exp2: measure each directory from output of the `ls` command.

  - NOTE: `ls -1` list one file per line.

```bash
ls -1 | xargs du -sh
```

- Exp3: search through `man` pages.

```bash
man -k <KEYWORD>
```

- Exp4: some commands utility (Clear the option by using: `manopt id -G`).

```bash
info coreutils "ls invocation"
groups
id -Gn
ls -gloRF --dired tmp
```

2. Learning Linux from scratch (again): `Linux for Beginners` book.

- Prompt: display the common format `username@servername`, and will determine the user is using the system as `normal user ($)` or a `super user (#)`.

- `Superuser` on a Linux system also calles as `root` -> `sudo` ~ `SuperUser Do`: grant specific users root privileges for specific cases.

- `~` := `tilde` is a shorthand way of representing the home directory for the current user.

- `Linux Directory Structure/Layout`:

  - Common Directories: `man hier` ~ description of the file system hierarchy.

    - NOTE: `*` := asterisk means that the directories was mentioned that can be easily skim over.

  - Application Directory Structure: `appname: [/bin, /etc, /lib, /logs]`

- Listing files by Type:

  - A `link`: is sometimes called as a `symlink`, short for symbolic link. A link points to the location of the actual file a directory.
  - `Symbolic links`: can be used to create shortcuts to long directory names. Another common use is to have a symlink to the latest version of installed software.
  - NOTE: you can operate on the link as if it were the actual file or directoy.

  ```bash
  ls -F
  ls -R
  ```

  - `ls` options demystify:

    - `-r`: display list files in reverse datetime order.
    - `-R`: display recursively.
    - `-F`: option will append a character to the file name that reveals what type it is.

    | Symbol | Meaning                                                               |
    | :----: | :-------------------------------------------------------------------- |
    |   /    | Directory                                                             |
    |   @    | Link. The file that follows the `->` symbol is the target of the link |
    |   \*   | Executable program                                                    |

- Default Permissions and the File Creation Mask:

  - Definition: The file creation mask is what determines the permission attach simultaneously with the new born file. The mask restricts or mask permissions, thus determining the ultimate permission for a file or directory will be given.

  - Syntax:

  ```bash
  umask [-S] [mode] <file/dir>
  umask -S 0027 ~/tmp
  ```

  - Explanation:

    - `-S`: set the mode with the symbolic notation (exp: `u=rwx,g=rx,o=`).
    - `[mode]`: identical with the octal/numeric based permission in `chmod` command.
    - Default mode that will apply to all of the newly created file inside the `~/tmp` directory will be:

    |                     | Dir  | File |
    | :------------------ | :--: | :--: |
    | Base Permission     | 777  | 666  |
    | Minus Umask         | -027 | -027 |
    | Creation Permission | 750  | 640  |

- Special modes:

  - Look at this example: there's an extra leading `0`, last 3 characters represent permissions for `user, group, other`.
  - The first numeric represents for the class of special modes := `{ setuid, setgid, sticky }`. (\[Un\]Set `sticky` mode to a directory)
  - NOTE: (`umask 0022` === `umask 022`) && (`chmod 0644` === `chmod 644`).

  | Special Mode      | Description                                                                                               |
  | :---------------- | :-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
  | setuid permission | Allows a process to run as the owner of the file.                                                         |
  | setgid permission | Allows a process to run with the group of the file, not with the group user use to execute it.            |
  | sticky bit        | Prevents a user from deleting another user's files even if they would normally have permissions to do so. |

  ```bash
  $ umask
  0027

  $ chmod u+t,o-t ~/tmp
  drwxrw-rw- 3 usr usr 4096 Aug 16 17:00 tmp/
  ```

- Finding files:

  - `find`: an equivalent to a search toolbox in Linux system. Let's jump right into an example to analyze each molecule/atom/iota of this command:

  ```bash
  find . -newer <file> - [Finds files that are newer than the given file.]
  ```

  ```bash
  find ./tmp/ -name "*txt" -size -100k -mtime +10 -exec grep -nrH [[:digit:]]* {} \;
               |            |           |          |--------------------------------> `-exec <command> {} \;`    := executes this command against all the files that are found.
               |            |           |-------------------------------------------> `-mtime <num_days>`        := constrains the results by the order of time (+/-: more/less than <num_days> old).
               |            |-------------------------------------------------------> `-size <num>[c/k/M/G]`     := constrains the results by the file size limitation (+/-: more/less than <num> size).
               |--------------------------------------------------------------------> `-name/-iname "<pattern>"` := displays file whose name matches the pattern, case-sensitive or insensitive.
  ```

  - `locate`: find file by name. If you know a file's name or at least part of its name, the main purpose is retrieve the location where it resides.
    The `locate` command can half recognize the pattern and return the list of all absolute paths of files that its name was matched the pattern.

  ```bash
  locate *.sh
  ```

  - [The "/etc/passwd" file](http://www.linfo.org/etc_passwd.html) : a text file that contains the _attributes_ (basic information about) each user/account on a computer running Linux/Unix-like operating system.

    - Each line in `/etc/passwd` represents a single user/account:

    > - The first line: listed `root/administrator` account, which has complete power over every aspect of the system.
    > - The last lines: represents real people who are use the system.

    - Each line contains 7 attributes/fields: `[ name, password, userID, groupID, gecos, home-directory, shell ]`, each field is separated from the adjacent by the colons (`:`) with no spaces. If there is no data for an attribute, there is no space, but, rather, 2 consecutive colons.

    | Attribute/Field | Description                                                                                                                                                                      |

    | password        | Contains excrypted login passwords, for security reason, the real passwords now storing in `/etc/shadow` that cannot be read by ordinary user.                                   |
    |                 | If the field contains the letter (x) indicates that the system required a password for authenticate this user.                                                                   |

    | groupID         | Specifies the user's principal group identification number. This is usually the same as the user ID.                                                                             |
    | gecos           | Acronym for `General Electric Comprehensive Operating System`, contains general information about the user that is not needed by the system, most commonly the user's real name. |
    |                 | Alternatively, it can contain multiple entries, each separated by a comma.                                                                                                       |
