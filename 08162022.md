1. `xargs`: using `stdout` as `stdin` for command not allowed stream input.

- Exp1: copy all the files with same extension to destination directory.

  - NOTE: `cp -t` specify destination folder for the `copy` command.

```bash
find ~/Downloads/ -name "*.jpg" | xargs cp -t .
```

- Exp2: measure each directory from output of the `ls` command.

  - NOTE: `ls -1` list one file per line.

```bash
ls -1 | xargs du -sh
```

- Exp3: search through `man` pages.

```bash
man -k <KEYWORD>
```

2. Learning Linux from scratch (again): `Linux for Beginners` book.

- Prompt: display the common format `username@servername`, and will determine the user is using the system as `normal user ($)` or a `super user (#)`.

- `Superuser` on a Linux system also calles as `root` -> `sudo` ~ `SuperUser Do`: grant specific users root privileges for specific cases.

- `~` := `tilde` is a shorthand way of representing the home directory for the current user.

- `Linux Directory Structure/Layout`:

  - Common Directories: `man hier` ~ description of the file system hierarchy.

    - NOTE: `*` := asterisk means that the directories was mentioned that can be easily skim over.

- Listing files by Type: `-F` option will append a character to the file name that reveals what type it is.

```bash
ls -F
```
