1. `xargs`: using `stdout` as `stdin` for command not allowed stream input.

- Exp1: copy all the files with same extension to destination directory.

  - NOTE: `cp -t` specify destination folder for the `copy` command.

  ```bash
  find ~/Downloads/ -name "*.jpg" | xargs cp -t .
  ```

- Exp2: measure each directory from output of the `ls` command.

  - NOTE: `ls -1` list one file per line.

  ```bash
  ls -1 | xargs du -sh
  ```

- Exp3: search through `man` pages.

  ```bash
  man -k <KEYWORD>
  ```

- Exp4: some commands utility (Clear the option by using: `manopt id -G`).

  ```bash
  info coreutils "ls invocation"
  groups
  id -Gn
  ls -gloRF --dired tmp
  ```

2. Learning Linux from scratch (again): `Linux for Beginners` book.

- Prompt: display the common format `username@servername`, and will determine the user is using the system as `normal user ($)` or a `super user (#)`.

- `Superuser` on a Linux system also calles as `root` -> `sudo` ~ `SuperUser Do`: grant specific users root privileges for specific cases.

- `~` := `tilde` is a shorthand way of representing the home directory for the current user.

- `Linux Directory Structure/Layout`:

  - Common Directories: `man hier` ~ description of the file system hierarchy.

    - NOTE: `*` := asterisk means that the directories was mentioned that can be easily skim over.

  - Application Directory Structure: `appname: [/bin, /etc, /lib, /logs]`

- Listing files by Type:

  - A `link`: is sometimes called as a `symlink`, short for symbolic link. A link points to the location of the actual file a directory.
  - `Symbolic links`: can be used to create shortcuts to long directory names. Another common use is to have a symlink to the latest version of installed software.
  - NOTE: you can operate on the link as if it were the actual file or directoy.

    ```bash
    ls -F
    ls -R
    ```

  - `ls` options demystify:

    - `-r`: display list files in reverse datetime order.
    - `-R`: display recursively.
    - `-F`: option will append a character to the file name that reveals what type it is.

    | Symbol | Meaning                                                               |
    | :----: | :-------------------------------------------------------------------- |
    |   /    | Directory                                                             |
    |   @    | Link. The file that follows the `->` symbol is the target of the link |
    |   \*   | Executable program                                                    |

- Default Permissions and the File Creation Mask:

  - Definition: The file creation mask is what determines the permission attach simultaneously with the new born file. The mask restricts or mask permissions, thus determining the ultimate permission for a file or directory will be given.

  - Syntax:

    ```bash
    umask [-S] [mode] <file/dir>
    umask -S 0027 ~/tmp
    ```

  - Explanation:

    - `-S`: set the mode with the symbolic notation (exp: `u=rwx,g=rx,o=`).
    - `[mode]`: identical with the octal/numeric based permission in `chmod` command.
    - Default mode that will apply to all of the newly created file inside the `~/tmp` directory will be:

    |                     | Dir  | File |
    | :------------------ | :--: | :--: |
    | Base Permission     | 777  | 666  |
    | Minus Umask         | -027 | -027 |
    | Creation Permission | 750  | 640  |

- Special modes:

  - Look at this example: there's an extra leading `0`, last 3 characters represent permissions for `user, group, other`.
  - The first numeric represents for the class of special modes := `{ setuid, setgid, sticky }`. (\[Un\]Set `sticky` mode to a directory)
  - NOTE: (`umask 0022` === `umask 022`) && (`chmod 0644` === `chmod 644`).

  | Special Mode      | Description                                                                                               |
  | :---------------- | :-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
  | setuid permission | Allows a process to run as the owner of the file.                                                         |
  | setgid permission | Allows a process to run with the group of the file, not with the group user use to execute it.            |
  | sticky bit        | Prevents a user from deleting another user's files even if they would normally have permissions to do so. |

  ```bash
  $ umask
  0027

  $ chmod u+t,o-t ~/tmp
  drwxrw-rw- 3 usr usr 4096 Aug 16 17:00 tmp/
  ```

- Finding files:

  - `find`: an equivalent to a search toolbox in Linux system. Let's jump right into an example to analyze each molecule/atom/iota of this command:

    ```bash
    [Syntax]
    find . -newer <file> - [Finds files that are newer than the given file.]
    ```

    ```bash
    find ./tmp/ -name "*txt" -size -100k -mtime +10 -exec grep -nrH [[:digit:]]* {} \;
                 |            |           |          |
                 |            |           |          +--------------------------------> `-exec <command> {} \;`    := executes this command against all the files that are found.
                 |            |           +-------------------------------------------> `-mtime <num_days>`        := constrains the results by the order of time (+/-: more/less than <num_days> old).
                 |            +-------------------------------------------------------> `-size <num>[c/k/M/G]`     := constrains the results by the file size limitation (+/-: more/less than <num> size).
                 +--------------------------------------------------------------------> `-name/-iname "<pattern>"` := displays file whose name matches the pattern, case-sensitive or insensitive.
    ```

    ```bash
    find . -type d -a -regextype "egrep" -regex ".*tmp.*"
    find . -type f -a -regextype "egrep" -regex ".*tmp.*"
            |       |  |                  |
            |       |  |                  +---------------> `-regex <pattern>` := search for file name that matched the regex pattern, note that this is match on the "whole path", not a partial recognition.
            |       |  +----------------------------------> `-regextype [posix-awk | posix-basic | posix-egrep | posix-extended]` := changes the regex syntax understood by `-regex/-iregex` tests later on.
            |       +-------------------------------------> `-type <OS_supported>` :=  POSIX specifies `b`, `c`, `d`, `l`, `p`, `f`, and `s`.
            +---------------------------------------------> `-a/-o` := Operator join together the other items within the expression `-o ~ logical OR`, `-a ~ logical AND`.
    ```

  - `locate`: find file by name. If you know a file's name or at least part of its name, the main purpose is retrieve the location where it resides.
    The `locate` command can half recognize the pattern and return the list of all absolute paths of files that its name was matched the pattern.

    ```bash
    locate *.sh
    ```

  - [The "/etc/passwd" file](http://www.linfo.org/etc_passwd.html) : a text file that contains the _attributes_ (basic information about) each user/account on a computer running Linux/Unix-like operating system.

    - Each line in `/etc/passwd` represents a single user/account:

    > - The first line: listed `root/administrator` account, which has complete power over every aspect of the system.
    > - The last lines: represents real people who are use the system.

    - Each line contains 7 attributes/fields: `[ name, password, userID, groupID, gecos, home-directory, shell ]`, each field is separated from the adjacent by the colons (`:`) with no spaces. If there is no data for an attribute, there is no space, but, rather, 2 consecutive colons.

    | Attribute/Field | Description                                                                                                                                                                      |

    | password        | Contains excrypted login passwords, for security reason, the real passwords now storing in `/etc/shadow` that cannot be read by ordinary user.                                   |
    |                 | If the field contains the letter (x) indicates that the system required a password for authenticate this user.                                                                   |

    | groupID         | Specifies the user's principal group identification number. This is usually the same as the user ID.                                                                             |
    | gecos           | Acronym for `General Electric Comprehensive Operating System`, contains general information about the user that is not needed by the system, most commonly the user's real name. |
    |                 | Alternatively, it can contain multiple entries, each separated by a comma.                                                                                                       |

- Comparing files:

  ```bash
  diff <file1> <file2> - [Compare two files.]
  sdiff <file1> <file2> - [Compare two files side by side.]
  vimdiff <file1> <file2> - [Highlight the differences between two files in the vim editor.]
  ```

- Searching in files:

  - Searching for Text in Ascii files:

    ```bash
    [Syntax]
    grep -v <pattern> <file> - [Invert match, return lines not match the pattern.]
    grep -i <pattern> <file> - [Perform searching pattern ignoring case.]
    grep -c <pattern> <file> - [Count the number of occurences in a file.]
    grep -n <pattern> <file> - [Precede output with numbers of line that contains the pattern.]
    ```

  - Search for Text in Binary files:

    ```bash
    [Syntax]
    strings <file> | grep <pattern> - [`strings`: Display printable strings in binary files.]
    ```

  - Examples:

    ```bash
    man ulimit | grep -E -C 8 "^[[:blank:]]*ulimit"

    # Search for `Input Record Separator`:
    man awk | col -b | grep -iE "\brs\b" -C 1

    cat /etc/passwd | grep user | cut -d: -f1,3,6 | sed 's/:/ /g'

    ps aux | awk '{ print $2, $11 }' OFS='\t' | grep -i java
    ```

- Pipe:

  - Definition: The pipe (`|`) means take the `standard output` from the `preceding command` and `pass` it as the `standard input` to the `following command`.
  - Canonically, you will notice that 2 commands have been chained together with a vertical bar (`|`).

  - Exp:

    ```bash
    cat /etc/passwd | grep <user> | cut -d: -f1,6,7 | sed 's/:/ /g'
                                         |   |
                                         |   +----------------------> `-f <N>`     := displays the `Nth` field.
                                         +--------------------------> `-d <delim>` := uses delimiter as the field separator.
    ```

- Sorting data: in the simplest form, `sort` sorts lines of text alphabetically.

  ```bash
  [Syntax]
  sort file - [Sort text in file.]
  sort -k F file - [Sort by key. The `F` following `-k` is the field number.]
  sort -r file - [Sort in reverse order.]
  sort -u file - [Sort text in file, removing duplicate lines.]
  ```

- Creating a Collection of files:

  - Definition: bundle a group of files/directories together in an archive.

    ```bash
    [Syntax]
    tar [-] c|x|t f <tarfile> [pattern] - [Create, extract or list contents of a `tar` archive using pattern, if supplied.]

    c - Create a tar archive.
    x - Extract files from the archive.
    t - Display the table of contents (list) of an archive.
    v - Causes tar to be verbose.
    f <file> - The tar archive file to perform operations against.
    z - Filter archive through compress (ie: gzip).
    ```

  - Exp:

    ```bash
    # Create a new tar archive:
    $ tar zcf something.tgz *.txt

    # Create a new tar archive in verbose mode:
    $ tar zcvf something.tgz *.txt
    a.txt

- Compressing files to save space: `gzip`, `gunzip`.

  - Syntax and convention of compressing files process:

    ```bash
    [Syntax]
    gzip file - [Compress file. The resulting compressed file is named file.gz.]
    gunzip file - [Uncompress files.]
    gzcat / zcat - [Concatenates and prints compressed files.]

    Use the command `du` to display how much space is used by a file:
    du - [Estimates file usage.]
    du -k - [Display sizes in Kilobytes.]
    du -h - [Display sizes in human readable format. For example, 1.2M, 3.7G, etc.]
    ```

  - Examples:

    - When run across an older version of `tar` without `gzip` compression built-in -> can use pipes to create compressed archive:

      ```bash
      # `.tar.gz` or `.tgz`: compress `tar` archive to a zipped file.
      tar cf - *.txt | gzip > test.tgz
      ```

- Redirection:

  - Common:

    | I/O Name        | Abbreviation File | Descriptor Number |
    | :-------------- | :---------------- | :---------------: |
    | standard input  | stdin             |         0         |
    | standard output | stdout            |         1         |
    | standard error  | stderr            |         2         |

  - Standard Output Redirection:

    | Operation | Description                                                                                                                         |
    | :-------- | :---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
    | >         | Redirects standard output to a file, overwriting (truncating) any existing contents of the file. If no file exists, it creates one. |
    | >>        | Redirects standard output to a file and appends to any existing contents. If no file exists, it creates one.                        |
    | <         | Redirects input from a file to the command preceding the less-than sign.                                                            |

  - Standard Error Redirection:

    - `File descriptor 1` is the default file descriptor for output redirection.
    - By using the default file descriptor for output redirection may cause some misbehaviors/miscaptured output generated by a program.
    - If you want to capture both `stdout` and `stderr`, use `2>&1`.
    - If you want to use a file descriptor instead of a file name, use the ampersand `&` symbol.

    - Example:

      ```bash
      ls ./not_exist_file 2>out.err                  := redirect `stderr` to a file.
      ls ./not_exist_file ./exist_dir >out.both 2>&1 := redirect `stderr` to `stdout`. If you omit `&`, `1` will be treated as a file name 1.
                                                     := send the `stdout` of `ls ./not_exist_file ./exist_dir` to `out.both` after appending `stderr` to `stdout`.
      ```

    | Operation   | Description                                                                                  |
    | :---------- | :------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
    | &           | Used with redirection to signal that a file descriptor is being used instead of a file name. |
    | 2>&1        | Combine standard error and standard output.                                                  |
    | 2> \<file\> | Redirect standard error to a file.                                                           |

- Null Device:

  - `>/dev/null` - [Redirect output to nowhere.]
  - Goal: ignore `stdout` and send it to null device, `/dev/null`. The null device is a special file that throws away whatever is fed to it.
  - `/dev/null` null device can be refer as the bit bucket.

  - Examples:

    ```bash
    $ ls ./not_exist_dir ./exist_file 2>/dev/null
    ./exist_file

    $ ls ./not_exist_dir ./exist_file >/dev/null 2>&1
    <return nothing>
    ```

- [Here Document](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Here_document): (here-document, heredoc, here-text, hereis, here-string, and here-script)

  - Definition: is a file literal or input stream literal, it is a section of a source code/normal text file that is treated as if it were separated file.
    Also applied for multiline string literals that use similar syntax, preserving line breaks and whitespace (indentation).

  - Examples:

    ```bash
    $ LANG=C tr a-z A-Z <<DOC
    > one two three
    > DOC
    ONE TWO THREE
    ```

    ```bash
    $ cat <<DOC
    > Current directory: $PWD or `pwd`.
    > DOC
    Current directory: /home/user or /home/user.
    ```

    ```bash
    $ tr a-z A-Z <<-DOC
    > <<-:
    >   tabs are ignored.
    >  spaces are preserved.
    > DOC
    <<-:
    tabs are ignored
     spaces are preserved.
    ```

    ```bash
    $ cat << EOF > ~/test.txt
    > redirect heredoc content to a new file.
    > EOF
    ```

    ```bash
    $ tr a-z A-Z <<< 'this is a herestring.'
    THIS IS A HERESTRING.
    ```

    ```bash
    $ tr a-z A-Z <<< "this is
    > a here string."
    THIS IS
    A HERESTRING
    ```

    ```bash
    $ bc <<< 2^10
    1024
    ```

    ```bash
    $ read -r a b c <<< 'one two three'
    $ printf "%s\n%s\n%s\n" $a $b $c
    one
    two
    three
    ```

  - NOTE:

    - `herestring` versus `heredoc`: `herestring` does not use delimiters such as leading (`^`) and trailing (`$`) newlines.
    - `herestring` is particularly useful for commands that often take short input, such as the calculator command `bc`.
    - `herestring` is particularly useful when last command needs to run in the current process, such as in the case with the builtin command `read`.

- Transfer file between local machine and remote host:

  - `scp`: secure copy (remote file copy program).

    ```bash
    [Syntax]
    [Stand at Remote Host]
    scp -P[portnumber] file_at_remote_host [local_user]@[local_ip_address]:/your/path/

    [Stand at Local]
    scp -P[portnumber] [remote_user]@[remote_ip_address]:/remote/path/file_at_remote_host /your/path/
    ```

  - `sftp`: secure file transfer program. After `sftp` into the remote shell, execute `help` or `?` to get the list of all available commands.

    ```bash
    sftp -P[portnumber] [remote_user]@[remote_ip_address]
    ```

  - Example: transfer file from remote host to local machine when you're standing on the local side.

    ```bash
    scp -P 22 user@10.10.10.10:~/.bashrc ./bashrc_tmp

    sftp -P 22 user@10.10.10.10
    sftp> get /path/to/remote_file := will download your wishes file to the current local directory.
    ```

- Bash Shell manipulation:

  - Customizing the Prompt: by modifying the builtin system variable `$PS1` in Linux.

    | \$     | If the effective UID is `0`, a `#`, otherwise a `$`.                                |

  - `Interactive ~ Login` and `Non-interactive ~ Non-login` Sessions:

    - Distinguish: An `Interactive` session have been started when you had logged on the remote shell environment. A `Non-interactive` session is when you just `ssh` in, to run an exact one command.
    - The content of `.profile` and `.bash_profile` are only executed for interactive sessions.
    - To avoid the hassle when interactive and non-interactive sessions behave divergent/opposed, configure `.bash_profile` to reference `.bashrc` and put all the configurations in `.bashrc`.

    - Example:

      ```bash
      [.bash_profile]

      if [ -f ~/.bashrc ]; do
        source ~/.bashrc |& . ~/.bashrc
      fi
      ```

  - Shell History:

    - History files: `[ ~/.bash_history, ~/.history, ~/.zsh_history ]`.
    - Access to shell history to repeat commands via keystrokes:

      | Command      | Description                                               |
      | :----------- | :-------------------------------------------------------- |
      | `history`    | Display a list of commands in shell history.              |
      | `!N`         | Repeat command `number N`.                                |
      | `!-N`        | Execute the `Nth` previous command.                       |
      | `!!` ~ `!-1` | Repeat the previous command line.                         |
      | `!string`    | Repeat the most recent command start with `string`.       |
      | Ctrl + r     | Reverse search. Search for command in your shell history. |

  - Shell Command Line Editing: shell such as `bash`, `ksh`, `tcsh`, and `zsh` provide 2 command line editing modes. They are `emacs`, which is typically default mode, and `vi`.

    - Emacs: `Ctrl + e` - Move to the end of the line.
    - Vi:

      - `A` ~ Enter insert mode, append text at end of line.
      - `I` ~ Enter insert edit mode, prepend text to start of line.
      - `v` ~ Edit the current command line in the editor defined by the `$EDITOR` environment variable.

    | Shell | Emacs Mode     | Vi Mode      | Default mode |
    | ----- | -------------- | ------------ | ------------ |
    | bash  | `set -o emacs` | `set -o vi`  | emacs        |
    | ksh   | `set -o emacs` | `set -o vi`  | none         |
    | tcsh  | `bindkey -e`   | `bindkey -v` | emacs        |
    | zsh   | `bindkey -e`   | `bindkey -v` | emacs        |
    | zsh   | `set -o emacs` | `set -o vi`  | emacs        |

- Processes and Job control:

  - Listing Processes and Displaying information:

    - To display the currently running processes we use the `ps` command. If no options are specified, it will displays the processes associated with our current session.
    - Common options and examples :

      ```bash
      [Syntax]
      ps - [Display process status.]

      -e - Everything, all processes. Identical to -A.
      -f - Full format listing.
      -u <username> - Display processes running as username.
      -p <pid> - Display process info rmation for <pid>. A PID is a process ID.
      ```

      ```bash
      [Examples]
      ps -e - Display all processes.
      ps -ef - Display all processes.
      ps -eH - Display a process tree .
      ps -e --forest - Display a process tree.
      ps -u <username> - Display processes running by username.
      ps -fu <username> - Display processes running by username in full format listing.
      ```

    - Some other commands that allow user to view running processes:

      ```bash
      pstree - Display running processes in a tree format.
      htop - Interactive process viewer. This command is less common than `top` and may not be available on the system.
      top - Interactive process viewer.
      ```

  - Running Processes in the Foreground and Background:

    - When a command, process or programs is running in the foreground the shell prompt will not be displayed until that process exits.
    - For long duration and stable running program/process it can be convinient to send them to the background.
      Processes that are backgrounded still execute and perform their task without blocking user from entering further commands at the shell prompt.
    - To background a process, place an ampersand `&` at the end of the command: `[%num]` is the job number corresponded to each job in the `jobs` command output.
    - The plus sign (`+`) in the jobs output represents the `current job` while the minus sign (`-`) represents the `previous job`.
    - The `current job` is considered to be the "last job that was stopped while it was in the foreground" or the "last job started in the background".
      The `current job` can be referred to by `%%` or `%+`.
    - If no job information is supplied to the `fg` or `bg` commands, the current job is operated upon.
      The `previous job` can be referred to by `%-`.

    | Command       | Description                              |
    | :------------ | :--------------------------------------- |
    | `<command> &` | Start command in the background.         |
    | Ctrl + c      | Kill the foreground process.             |
    | Ctrl + z      | Pause or suspend the foreground process. |
    | `bg [%num]`   | Background a suspended process.          |
    | `fg [%num]`   | Foreground a background process.         |
    | `kill [%num]` | Kill a process by job number or PID.     |
    | `jobs [%num]` | List jobs.                               |

  - [Killing processes](https://www.gnu.org/software/bash/manual/html_node/Job-Control-Builtins.html):

    - The default signal used by `kill` command is termination. This signal referred to as `SIGTERM` or `TERM` for short.
    - Signals have numbers that correspond to their name. The default `TERM` signal is 15, so these 3 commands below are equivalent:

      ```bash
      kill <pid>
      kill -15 <pid>
      kill -TERM <pid>
      ```

    - Some basic cammand and keystroke:

      | Command               | Description                   |
      | :-------------------- | :---------------------------- |
      | Ctrl + c              | Kills the foreground process. |
      | `kill [signal] <pid>` | Send a signal to a process.   |
      | `kill -l`             | List of all signals.          |

    - Examples:

      ```bash
      # KILL/SIGKILL signal is number 9:
      $ ps | grep hard-to-stop
      27398 pts/1 00:00:00 hard-to-stop
      $  kill -9 27398 # Send SIGKILL to process "hard-to-stop".
      $ ps | grep hard-to-stop
      <return nothing>
      ```

- Scheduling Repeated Jobs with [cron](https://crontab.guru/):

  - Definition:

    > - `cron`: A time based job scheduling service. This service typically started when the system boots.
    > - `crontab`: A program to create, read, update, and delete your job shcedules. `Crontab` (`cron` table) is a configuration file that specifies when commands are to be executed by `cron`.
    >   Each line in a `crontab` represents a job and contains 2 pieces of information: 1) when to run and 2) what to run.

  - `Crontab` format:

    ```bash
    # An asterisk (*) which matches any time or date for that field.
    * * * * * <command>
    | | | | |
    | | | | +--> Day of the Week (0-6) (0: Sunday)
    | | | +----> Month of the Year (1-12)
    | | +------> Day of the Month (1-31)
    | +--------> Hour (0-23)
    +----------> Minute (0-59)
    ```
