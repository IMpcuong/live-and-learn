|            DOS            | Linux/UNIX |
| :-----------------------: | :--------: |
|            cd             |     cd     |
|          attrib           |   chmod    |
|           comp            |    diff    |
|           copy            |     cp     |
|            del            |     rm     |
|            rd             |   rmdir    |
|            dir            |     ls     |
|            set            |  printenv  |
|           find            |    grep    |
|           help            |    man     |
|            md             |   mkdir    |
|           move            |     mv     |
|       ren (rename)        |     mv     |
|        date, time         |    date    |
|          chkdsk           |     df     |
|           type            |    cat     |
| type \<filename\> \| more |    more    |
|           sort            |    sort    |

- Example:

```cmd
dir | sort /R
```

2. Some `grep` examples integrated with `find` and `globstar: **`:

- NOTE:

  - `glob` ~ `*`: was called as `GLOB` expression.
  - If Bash version is 4 or higher, can make use of Bashâ€™s `globstar` (`**`) to match files recursively.

- exp1: Using `grep` with **_--include=Glob_**, search for the pattern only with the `.log/.md` extension recursively in the `test/` folder:

```bash
grep -R --include=*.log 'Exception' test/
grep -R --include=*.{log,md} 'Exception' test/
```

- exp2: With `globstar` expression, the `-R` recursive option is now totally useless:

```bash
grep 'Exception' test/**/*.log
grep 'Exception' test/**/*.{log,md}
```

- exp3: Only using `find` command with the example filename pattern "app_20200301.log":

```bash
find test/ -type f -a -regextype 'egrep' -regex '.*_[0-9]{8}.*'
```

- exp4: Combining the `find` with `grep` in one command with the `-exec` action:

```bash
find test/ -type f -a -regextype 'egrep' -regex '.*_[0-9]{8}.*' -exec grep -H "Exception" '{}' \;
```

- NOTE (exp4):

  - The command requires the ending `\;`. This is because it indicates the termination of the grep command.
  - The `-exec` action will be executed on each file the find command has found.

- exp5: Using `xargs` to combine `find` and `grep`:

```bash
find test/ -type f -a -regextype 'egrep' -regex '.*_[0-9]{8}.*' | xargs grep "Exception"
```

- NOTE (exp5):

  - `xargs` will build matched files into bundles and run them through the command as few times as possible.
