### Process versus Thread demystification:

* Definition: `pid` is process identifier; `tid` is thread identifier.
* Kernel perspective:
  * There is no real distinction between them (process vs. thread):
    threads are just like processes but they share some things (memory, fds...) with other instances of the same group.

  * In multi-threaded environments, each thread has its own TID. All the threads from the same process have the same PID.

  * The TID is always equivalent to the LWP (LightWeight Process).
    The former is used in system interface functions, while the latter is used more often on the user side.

  * The number of threads within a process is the NLWP, which stands for the Number of LWP.

  * So, a `tid` is actually the identifier of the schedulable object
    (a smallest set of instructions that a processor can manipulates) in the kernel (thread).
    While the `pid` is the identifier of the group of schedulable objects that share memory and fds (process).
* NOTE:
  * It is worth noting that many functions/system calls/command line utilities documented to work with `pid` actually use `tids`.
    But if the effect is process-wide you will simply not notice the difference.
  * And to make it even more interesting: there is also the name `tgid` (thread group identifier) appearing in sources â€” you can already guess it is synonymous with `pid`.
