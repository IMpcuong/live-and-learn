1. Invokes command inside history list to manipulate as our promises:

- Modify a part or the whole content of the command as we needed to:

```bash
$ history
ssh -P22 user@111.112.30.30

$ !ssh:s/30/31/
ssh -P22 user@111.112.31.31
```

- Retrieve only the argument of the executed command:

```bash
$ touch 10042022.md

$ !-1*
10042022.md
bash: 10042022.md: command not found
```
