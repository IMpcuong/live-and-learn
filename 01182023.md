0. Variable assignment overloading in Golang:

```go
package main

import "fmt"

func main() {
	x := 1
	x, y := 10, 10 // NOTE: When multiple variables are declared by using the `:=` syntax, at least one needs to be new.
	fmt.Println(x, y) // Out: `10, 10`.
}
```

1. `Defer` keyword execution context:

- Learning curve:

  - https://www.golangtraining.in/lessons/defer/defer-evaluation.html
  - https://rakyll.org/inlined-defers/

- Example: Reversal order of execution with `fmt.Println` function:

```go
package main

import "fmt"

func reversePrint(upper int) {
	for i := 0; i < upper; i++ {
		defer fmt.Println(i)
		// NOTE: The actual call the statement (started with `defer` keyword)
		// 	begins right after the function it belongs returns.
	}
}

func main() {
	reversePrint(5)
	// Out:
	// 4
	// 3
	// 2
	// 1
	// 0
}
```

2. `recover()` builtin function:

- Definition: regains control of a panicking goroutine.
- `recover()` is only useful inside a deferred function.
- During normal execution, a call to `recover()` will return `nil` and have no other effect.
  If the goroutine is panicking, a call to recover will capture the value given to panic and
  resume normal execution.
