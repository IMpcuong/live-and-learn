1. `curl` command options:

- `-k, --insecure` := Allow insecure server connections.
- `-i, --include` := Include protocol response headers to the output.

2. `Golang` note:

- Keyword `~` denotes all underlying types: [Type parameter declarations][1]

```txt
By construction, an interface's type set never contains an interface type.

// An interface representing only the type int.
interface {
	int
}

// An interface representing all types with underlying type int.
interface {
	~int
}

// An interface representing all types with underlying type int that implement the String method.
interface {
	~int
	String() string
}

// An interface representing an empty type set: there is no type that is both an int and a string.
interface {
	int
	string
}
In a term of the form ~T, the underlying type of T must be itself, and T cannot be an interface.

type MyInt int

interface {
	~[]byte  // the underlying type of []byte is itself
	~MyInt   // illegal: the underlying type of MyInt is not MyInt
	~error   // illegal: error is an interface
}
Union elements denote unions of type sets:

// The Float interface represents all floating-point types
// (including any named types whose underlying types are
// either float32 or float64).
type Float interface {
	~float32 | ~float64
}
The type T in a term of the form T or ~T cannot be a type parameter, and the type sets of all non-interface terms must be pairwise disjoint (the pairwise intersection of the type sets must be empty). Given a type parameter P:

interface {
	P                // illegal: P is a type parameter
	int | ~P         // illegal: P is a type parameter
	~int | MyInt     // illegal: the type sets for ~int and MyInt are not disjoint (~int includes MyInt)
	float32 | Float  // overlapping type sets but Float is an interface
}
```

- Mnemonic `Go` pointer manipulation (different from `Rust`):

```go
package main

import "fmt"

func main() {
	var ptr *int
	dude1 := 10
	dude2 := &dude1
	dude3 := *dude2
	ptr = dude2
	fmt.Println(dude1, "\n", dude2, "\n", dude3, "\n", ptr, "\n", &ptr)
}

/*
  Output:
  10
    0xc000120000
    10
    0xc000120000
    0xc000118018
*/
```
