1. `SSH tunneling`: aka `SSH Port Forwarding` ~ the idea is to create a tunneling from the client machine to the server machine.

- Resource: [SSH Academy](https://www.ssh.com/academy/ssh/tunneling)

- Some examples:

  + Local forwarding: forwards a port from the client machine to the server machine.

  ```bash
  ssh -L 80:intra.example.com:80 gw.example.com
  ssh -L 127.0.0.1:80:intra.example.com:80 gw.example.com
  ```

  + Remote forwarding: allows anyone on the remote server to connect to a specified TCP port on the remote server.

  ```
  [sshd_config]
  GatewayPorts no
  GatewayPorts yes
  GatewayPorts clientspecified
  ```

  ```bash
  ssh -R 8080:localhost:80 public.example.com
  ssh -R 52.194.1.73:8080:localhost:80 host147.aws.example.com
  ```
