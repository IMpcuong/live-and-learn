1. Process versus thread compilation:

- A process is an instance of a computer program that is being executed by one or many threads.
- A thread is a single flow of execution within a process, meaning that a process can have multiple threads.
- The CPU, or Central Processing Unit, is the hardware component of a computer that executes instructions.

- The states of a process can vary depending on the operating system, but they generally include:

  ```txt
  New: The process has been created but has not yet been admitted to the CPU.
  Ready: The process is waiting to be assigned to a processor.
  Running: The process has been assigned to a processor and is currently being executed.
  Waiting: The process is waiting for a particular event, such as input or output, to occur before it can continue executing.
  Terminated: The process has finished executing and has been removed from the system.
  ```

- The states of a thread can also vary depending on the operating system, but they generally include:

  ```txt
  New: The thread has been created but has not yet started executing.
  Runnable: The thread is waiting to be assigned to a processor.
  Running: The thread is currently being executed on a processor.
  Waiting: The thread is waiting for a particular event, such as input or output, to occur before it can continue executing.
  Blocked: The thread is unable to continue executing because it is waiting for a resource that is currently being used by another thread.
  Terminated: The thread has finished executing and has been removed from the system.
  ```
