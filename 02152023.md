0. `Win32 API` acronyms demystification:

- In Win32 API functions, `W`, `Ex`, and `A` are suffixes that indicate the character set and other variations in the function names. Specifically:

  - `W` stands for `Wide`, which indicates that the function uses Unicode character encoding. For example, the function `MessageBoxW` displays a message box with Unicode text.

  - `Ex` stands for `Extended`, which indicates that the function has an extended version with additional parameters. For example, the function `CreateWindowExW` creates a window with extended style options and uses Unicode character encoding.

  - `A` stands for `Ansi`, which indicates that the function uses the legacy ANSI character encoding. For example, the function `MessageBoxA` displays a message box with ANSI text.

- In general, it's recommended to use the `W` versions of the functions whenever possible, as they support a wider range of characters and are more compatible with internationalization and localization. However, the `A` versions may still be necessary for compatibility with older software or certain system configurations.
