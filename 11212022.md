1. `Mutex` definition unmasked:

- `Mutex`: is an abbreviation of `Mutual Exclusion Object`. In computer programming, a `mutex` is a program object
  that allows multiple program `threads` to share the same resource, such as file access, but not simultaneously.
  When a program is started, a mutex created with an unique name. After this stage, any thread
  that needs the resource must lock the mutex from other threads while it is using the resource.
  The mutex is set to unlock when the data is no longer needed or the routine is finished.
