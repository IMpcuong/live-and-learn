1. NOTE: `public_domain` is the domain you do not want the `proxy_server` interfere on
or for a short conclusion is bypass the proxy server with some listed specific domains name.

- Set environment variables (variable name must be 100% identical with the given list below, in insensitive case)

- Session:

```cmd
[cmd]
set https_proxy=<proxy_ip>:<port>
set http_proxy=<proxy_ip>:<port>
```

- Disable `SAM-Telemetry` ~ tool to collect user information (?):
[AWS Telemetry](aws-serverless-tools-telemetry.us-west-2.amazonaws)

```cmd
set no_proxy="<public_domain>,<proxy_ip>"
setx SAM_CLI_TELEMETRY 0
```

- Forever:

```pwsh
setx /M http_proxy "<proxy_ip>:<port>"
[Environment]::SetEnvironmentVariable("http_proxy", "<proxy_ip>:<port>", "Machine")
```

- And checking if it was appeared in the environment variables list:

```cmd
[cmd]
C:\Users\user> set | findstr /I proxy
https_proxy=<proxy_ip>:<port>
http_proxy=<proxy_ip>:<port>
no_proxy=<public_domain>,<proxy_ip>
```
