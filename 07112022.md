0. Tips and tricks:

- When searching for flags or options in the `man page`, especially in the `BASH_BUILTINS (General Commands Manual)`:
you can use this quite unique regex pattern that will be described below

```vi
/^[[:blank:]]*<searching_opts>
```

1. Manipulating the environment varibales in Linux-based OS:

- Print a specific variable with the given name: (`printenv` only print all of these current env-variables)

```bash
echo $http_proxy
printenv http_proxy
```

- The `set` command utilize to print all of the current environment configurations within a different type
of lifetime (session/system):

- NOTE: it also print to the stdout all of the accessible/feasible custom or builin `funtions utility`:

```bash
set
set | less
```

- The `set -u` treats variables/parameters expansion/auto-completion as an error (when using `<TAB>`), how to fix that:

```bash
set +u
```

- The `unset` command have the contrast/divergence utility with the `set` command:

```bash
unset http_proxy
```
