1. `Dockerfile` for Java: run webserver tomcat

```Dockerfile
EXPOSE 8080 8080

CMD ["start.sh"]
```

Or:

```Dockerfile
EXPOSE 8080 8080

CMD ["catalina.sh", "run"]
```

- Some simple explanation for both of this commands:

> - `catalina.sh` run starts tomcat in the foreground, displaying the logs on the console that you started it. Hitting `Ctrl-C` will terminate tomcat.
>
> - `startup.sh` will start tomcat in the background. You'll have to `tail -f logs/catalina.out` to see the logs.
