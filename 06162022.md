### Preferences:

- [Configure Git to use a proxy](https://gist.github.com/evantoli/f8c23a37eb3558ab8765)

1. This is the ultimately correctness of `git clone` using `ssh` protocol with specific port:

```bash
git clone ssh://<username>@<domain>:2222/<username>/<repo>.git .
```

NOTE: clone a project to the current directory, without following the remote repo's name.

2. `nslookup`: an administration commandline tool for querying the Domain Name System to obtain the mapping between domian name - IP address - other DNS records

```cmd
C:\Users\user> nslookup /?
C:\Users\user> nslookup <domain_name>
Server:  <servername>
Address:  <IPv4>

Name:    <proxy_domain>
Address:  <IPv4>
```

3. `git config http.proxy`: to access the public Internet from your personal Windows PC that have been connected to a local private network

- Step1: Settings > Network & Internet > Automatic Proxy Setup || Manual Proxy Setup -> retrieve the proxy domain address (copy to clipboard).

- Step2:

```cmd
nslookup <copied_domain>
```

After that, copy the `IPv4` address of the `proxy_domain` to clipboard.

- Step3: `localport` can also be found in the in `Step1` (in the `Script address` or `Port` field)

```bash
git config --global http.sslverify false
git config --global http.proxy http://<IPv4>:<localport>
git clone https://github.com/<username>/<repo>
```

NOTE: this is a example when you want to clone a GitHub repository.
