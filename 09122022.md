1. Learning Docker from the ground up (again): `Docker in Action, Second Edition` book.

- What is Docker: an open source project for building, shipping and running programs. It's a command line program, a background process, and a set of remote services that take a logistical
  approach to solving common software problems and simplyfying your experience installing, running, publishing, and removing software.

  - `Best Practice` definition: this term is a concept or a mindset about how we, the developer of a software product/system, should be followed/yielded for a solid better outcomes.
  - `Best Practice` enhance security, prevent conflicts, improve serviceability, or increase longevity.
  - `Docker`: is a tool that makes adopting software packaging, distribution, and utilization best practices cheap and sensible defaults within providing a complete vision for process
    containers and simple tooling for building and working with them.
  - `Docker` accomplished all of these symplifying tasks by using an Linux operating system technology called _containers_.

- _"Hello, World!"_: (exp: `docker run dockerinaction/hello_world`)

  - Flow chart after running `docker run`:

  ```
  +------------+    +----------------------------------+    +------------------+       +----------------------------+    +------------------+
  | docker run | -> | Looks for image on this computer | -> | Is it installed? | -No-> | Searchs image on DockerHub | -> | Is on DockerHub? |
  +------------+    +----------------------------------+    +------------------+       +----------------------------+    +------------------+
         +------------------------+    +-----------------------------------------+    +-------------------------------------------+    +---------------------------+
  -Yes-> | Docker downloads image | -> | Image layers installed on this computer | -> | Creates new container, starts the program | -> | The container is running! |
         +------------------------+    +-----------------------------------------+    +-------------------------------------------+    +---------------------------+

  +------------+    +----------------------------------+    +------------------+        +-------------------------------------------+    +---------------------------+
  | docker run | -> | Looks for image on this computer | -> | Is it installed? | -Yes-> | Creates new container, starts the program | -> | The container is running! |
  +------------+    +----------------------------------+    +------------------+        +-------------------------------------------+    +---------------------------+
  ```

  - Note that, `dockerinaction/hello_world` is called as _the image/repository name_.

- Containers:

  - History: UNIX-style operating system have used the term _jail_ to describe a modified runtime environment that limits the scope of resources that a jailed program can access.
  - In 2005, _container_ has become the preferred term for such a runtime environment. The goal has expanded from limiting filesystem scope to isolating a process from all resources
    except the where explicitly allowed.
  - Any software run with Docker is run inside a container. Docker uses existing container engines to provide consistent containers built according to best practices.

- Containers are not virtualization:

  - `Virtual Machine`: provide virtual hardware, creating a whole network-attached virtual machine (or hardware on which an operating system and other program can be installed).
  - `Docker container`: don't use any hardware virtualization, programs running inside Docker containers interface directly with the host's Linux kernel.
    Many programs can run in isolation without running redundant operating system or suffering the delay of boot sequences.

  | Docker Container                            | Virtualization Machine                                  |
  | ------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------- |
  | Containers are an operating system feature. | Provide hardware abstraction to simulate the OS itself. |
