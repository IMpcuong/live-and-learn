- Jenkins-cloud, Jenkins-SDL, Jenkins-Configuration-as-Code.
- EKS Autoscale-group: scale-out not scale-up.
- Gitlab CI multi-agents, e.g. building CSharp source code -> strictly needs to use Windows machine.
- Blue-green deployment strategy: using the blue environmemt as a smoke test unit -> tesr HTTP status etc -> apply for production.
- Lambda weak-side: retention time approximately about 15-mins, bottleneck when
memory can be overloaded (minimum: 128Mb).
