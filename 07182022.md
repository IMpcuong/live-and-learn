1. Bash commands utilites:

- Some really fascinating hack commands:

	+ `tac`: concatenate and print files in reverse >< `cat` command.
	+ `man sort`: instead of using the normal `man` interactive window:

	```bash
	man sort
	info coreutils 'sort invocation'
	```

- Sorting in Bash: `sort`:

	+ `-s`: stabilize sort by disabling last-resort comparison.
	+ `-n`: sorts in numerical values.
	+ `-h`: compares human-readable numbers such as 1k, 1G
	+ `-R`: sort in random order but group the identical keys.
	+ `-r`: sort the values in reverse (descending order).
	+ `-o`: save ouput to a file
	+ `-c`: check if the input file is sorted; do not sort if true.
	+ `-u`: show unique values only.
	+ `-k`: sort the data via a specific key (useful when sorting columnar data).

	+ Exp: sorting in the numerical ascending order against processes ID (PID) data
	(`/proc` stores all of the running processes with each process represented by a dir which has the naming convention as its \<PID\>)

	```bash
	ls -la /proc | sort -nk 9 -s
	```

- Processes tree: `pstree`:

	+ `/proc`  location of the proc file system
	+ `-a`: show command line arguments.
	+ `-p`: show PIDs, PIDs are shown as decimal numbers in parenthesis after each process name.

	```bash
	pstree
	pstree -ap <PID>
	```
