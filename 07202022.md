3. Distinguish between `kilobyte` and `kibibyte` bytes in Computer Memory Measurement/Sizing/Quantification:

- Both are the unit of storage capacity.

- `kilo` (French): base 10 ~ 1000 (10^3) bytes, unit symbol for `kilobyte` is `kB`.

- `kibi` (English): base 2 ~ 1024 (2^10) bytes, `bi` := binary, unit symbol for `kibibyte` is `KiB/K`.

- Exp: `ls` command with `SIZE` property is an integer and optional unit (example: `10M is 10*1024*1024`).
  Units are K, M, G, T, P, E, Z, Y (powers of 1024) or KB, MB, ... (powers of 1000).

4. `vim` plugin: `netrw`

- `netrw` is a kind of vim plugin/script which supports reading and writing files across networks. `.netrwhist` is a history file which maintains all the directories that were modified. So whenever you modify the contents of `~/.vim` it adds one entry in `.netrwhist`.

- `netrw_dirhistmax`: indicates the maximum number of modified directories it stores in the history file, ie: Max History Size.

- `netrw_dirhist_cnt`: indicates the current history count of modified directories.
