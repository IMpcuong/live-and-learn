1. NOTE: Linux system.

- `env` - Run a program in a modified environment.

- Fascinating trick with `cd`: these 2 commands below are totally equivalent.

  ```bash
  cd -
  cd $OLDPWD
  ```

- [Dash "`-`" command line parameters](https://www.baeldung.com/linux/dash-in-command-line-parameters):
  Most of the commands of Linux treat the string "`-`" as a synonym for `stdin or stdout`.

  - For instance, when use `cat` command with naked `-`, it will read from the `stdin`:

    ```bash
    $ cat -
    Input text here and will be duplicated below. # ---> read from `stdin`.
    Input text here and will be duplicated below. # ---> `stdout` of `cat` command.
    ```

  - The `-` in the command above is actually an alias for `/dev/stdin`. Therefore, we can replace the dash with `/dev/stdin`.

    ```bash
    $ cat /dev/stdin
    Input text here and will be duplicated below. # ---> read from `stdin`.
    Input text here and will be duplicated below. # ---> `stdout` of `cat` command.
    ```

  - What is `/dev/stdin`? The answer is: `/dev/stdin` is a _symbolic link_ to `/proc/self/fd/0`. The `/proc/self/fd/0` also is a _symbolic link_ to the standard input or our current shell process, which turn out to be our terminal.
    For that reason, we're able to input text to the `cat` command using our terminal.

  - Like stdin, when `-` is used in the context of `stdout`, itâ€™s an alias for `/dev/stdout`:

    ```bash
    curl -L https://github.com/hishamhm/htop/archive/refs/tags/2.2.0.tar.gz --output -
    ```

  - In the case of git, we can use it as an argument to the git checkout command to check out the previous active branch or detached HEAD:

    ```bash
    $ git branch -a
    *master
    dev
    $ git checkout dev
    $ git branch -a
    master
    *dev
    $ git checkout -
    $ git branch -a
    *master
    dev
    ```

  - We can also use `-` as an argument to the cd command to switch between the current and the previous directory:

    ```bash
    $ pwd
    /home/hey/github
    $ cd TestApp
    $ pwd
    /home/hey/github/TestApp
    $ cd -
    $ pwd
    /home/hey/github
    $ cd -
    $ pwd
    /home/hey/github/TestApp
    ```
