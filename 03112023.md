- Best Solution:
  - Step1: `cd C:\Windows\ServiceProfiles\LocalService\AppData\Local\Microsoft\Ngc`
    NOTE: This directory hasn't been granted enough permissions (rwx) for the current user -> must bestow/assign/permit our user with
    the owner privileges on this `Ngc` directory.
  - Step2: Open `pwsh/cmd` in administrator mode, run this command:
    `icacls C:\Windows\ServiceProfiles\LocalService\AppData\Local\Microsoft\Ngc /T /Q /C /RESET`
  - Step3: Reset PIN in the Settings pages: `Settings/Accounts/Sign-in options/Windows Hello PIN`.
  - Step4: Restart your computer -> PIN is ready to use as usual.
