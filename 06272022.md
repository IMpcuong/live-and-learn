1. Debug container daemon running status in Windows:

```cmd
wget https://github.com/Microsoft/Virtualization-Documentation/raw/master/windows-server-container-tools/Debug-ContainerHost/Debug-ContainerHost.ps1
    -UseBasicParsin | iex
```

- Switch daemon to restart `docker`: (not working quite well, or maybe I can not reach the final result)

```cmd
& 'C:\Program Files\Docker\Docker\DockerCli.exe' -SwitchDaemon
```

or (even start or stop the `docker` service is still not working)

```cmd
net stop com.docker.service
net start com.docker.service
```

- All of these stucks happened even run with elevated privileges to connect.

2. `tasklist` lists all of the current running applications:

```cmd
tasklist /apps /fi "STATUS eq RUNNING"
```

and counting total number of `.exe` apllications if you want to:

```cmd
tasklist /apps /fi "STATUS eq RUNNING" | find /i "exe" /c
```

3. Enable full access for `HyperV`:

```pwsh
Enable-WindowsOptionalFeature -Online -FeatureName Microsoft-Hyper-V -All
```
