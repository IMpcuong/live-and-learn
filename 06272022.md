1. Debug container daemon running status in Windows:

```cmd
wget https://github.com/Microsoft/Virtualization-Documentation/raw/master/windows-server-container-tools/Debug-ContainerHost/Debug-ContainerHost.ps1
    -UseBasicParsin | iex
```

- Switch daemon to restart `docker`: (not working quite well, or maybe I can not reach the final result)

```cmd
& 'C:\Program Files\Docker\Docker\DockerCli.exe' -SwitchDaemon
```

or (even start or stop the `docker` service is still not working)

```cmd
net stop com.docker.service
net start com.docker.service
```

- All of these stuck happened even run with elevated privileges to connect.

2. `tasklist` lists all of the current running applications:

```cmd
tasklist /apps /fi "STATUS eq RUNNING"
```

and counting total number of `.exe` applications if you want to:

```cmd
tasklist /apps /fi "STATUS eq RUNNING" | findstr /i /c:"exe"
tasklist /fi "STATUS eq RUNNING" | findstr /i /r /c:"\.exe"
```

- NOTE: `tasklist`

    - `/fi` ~ filters with a specific/unambiguous/distinct/precise condition.
    - `/apps` ~ displays store apps ans their associated processes.

- NOTE: `findstr`

    - `/i` ~ inversion of case-sensitives in matching search result.
    - `/r` ~ uses search string as regular expressions.
    - `/c:string` ~ uses specified string as a literal search string.

3. Enable full access for `HyperV`:

```pwsh
Enable-WindowsOptionalFeature -Online -FeatureName Microsoft-Hyper-V -All
```

- Searching for `HyperV` launch type:

```pwsh
bcdedit /enum | findstr -i hypervisorlaunchtype (if stdout := off)
bcdedit /set hypervisorlaunchtype Auto (enabling `HyperV`)
```

4. Command line passing through as it is:

> `--` := Pass the remaining command line as is.

5. `wsl` commands utilities:

- Change default version:

```pwsh
wsl --set-default-version 2
```

- Disable `wsl` in `pwsh`:

```pwsh
Disable-WindowsOptionalFeature -Online -FeatureName Microsoft-Windows-Subsystem-Linux
```

- Enable `wsl` in `pwsh`:

```pwsh
dism.exe /online /enable-feature /featurename:Microsoft-Windows-Subsystem-Linux /all /norestart
```

- Disable `docker` from using `wsl` background feature (might run docker with the `VM` based):

> `C:\Users\<username>\AppData\Roaming\Docker\settings.json` -> Set `wslEngineEnabled` to false.

- Shutdown `Docker` totally: must run in administrator privileges:

```cmd
net stop com.docker.service
taskkill /IM "docker.exe" /F
taskkill /IM "Docker Desktop.exe" /F
wsl --shutdown
```

6. Turn on/off Windows Features from Windows Features:

- Solution1: open path `C:\Windows\System32\OptionalFeatures.exe` -> then tick to whichever features you wished to!

- Solution2: these 3 commands below achieving the same output to list all of these `disabled features` as expected:

```pwsh
Get-WindowsOptionalFeature -Online | Where-Object {$_.State -eq "Disabled"} (without full details)
Get-WindowsOptionalFeature -FeatureName * -Online | Where-Object {$_.State -eq "Disabled"} (full details)
Get-WindowsOptionalFeature -OnLine | Where-Object {$_.State -eq "Disabled"} | Out-GridView (output to grid-view)
```

Then you can enable which features as you want to:

```pwsh
Enable-WindowsOptionalFeature -FeatureName "<FeatureName>" -All -Online
```

- Solution3:

```cmd
dism /online /get-features /format:table | find "Disabled"
```

Then you can enable which features as you want to:

```cmd
dism /online /Enable-Feature /FeatureName:"<FeatureName>" -All
```

- NOTE: with the disable process, you just need to use, eg:

```pwsh
Disable-WindowsOptionalFeature -FeatureName "<Feature>" -Online
dism /online /Disable-Feature /FeatureName:"<Feature>"
```

7. Add local users to granted access higher privilege groups:

- Solution1: Win + R -> `lusrmgr.msc`

- Solution2:

```cmd
net localgroup "<Group>" "<User>" /add
net localgroup "<Group>" "<User>" /delete
```

- Solution3:

```pwsh
Add-LocalGroupMember -Group "<Group>" -Member "<User>"
Remove-LocalGroupMember -Group "<Group>" -Member "<User>"
```

- NOTE: fully activating features for Docker Desktop Windows

> - Step1: Normally, `docker-desktop` having `docker-users` group -> if your account is not admin account -> you needed to add in this group.
> - Step2: PC Settings -> Update and Recovery -> Recovery -> Restart Now.
> - Step3: Troubleshoot -> Advance Options -> UEFI Firmware Settings -> Restart.
> - Step4: Console F12 -> Configuration -> Ticking all Virtualization options -> Enabled.
