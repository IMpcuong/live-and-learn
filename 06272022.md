1. Debug container daemon running status in Windows:

```cmd
wget https://github.com/Microsoft/Virtualization-Documentation/raw/master/windows-server-container-tools/Debug-ContainerHost/Debug-ContainerHost.ps1
    -UseBasicParsin | iex
```

- Switch daemon to restart `docker`: (not working quite well, or maybe I can not reach the final result)

```cmd
& 'C:\Program Files\Docker\Docker\DockerCli.exe' -SwitchDaemon
```

or (even start or stop the `docker` service is still not working)

```cmd
net stop com.docker.service
net start com.docker.service
```

- All of these stucks happened even run with elevated privileges to connect.

2. `tasklist` lists all of the current running applications:

```cmd
tasklist /apps /fi "STATUS eq RUNNING"
```

and counting total number of `.exe` apllications if you want to:

```cmd
tasklist /apps /fi "STATUS eq RUNNING" | find /i "exe" /c
```

3. Enable full access for `HyperV`:

```pwsh
Enable-WindowsOptionalFeature -Online -FeatureName Microsoft-Hyper-V -All
```

- Searching for `HyperV` launch type:

```pwsh
bcdedit /enum | findstr -i hypervisorlaunchtype (if stdout := off)
bcdedit /set hypervisorlaunchtype Auto (enabling `HyperV`)
```

4. Command line passing through as it is:

> `--` := Pass the remaining command line as is.

5. `wsl` commands utiities:

- Change default version:

```pwsh
wsl --set-default-version 2
```

- Disable `wsl` in `pwsh`:

```pwsh
Disable-WindowsOptionalFeature -Online -FeatureName Microsoft-Windows-Subsystem-Linux
```

- Enable `wsl` in `pwsh`:

```pwsh
dism.exe /online /enable-feature /featurename:Microsoft-Windows-Subsystem-Linux /all /norestart
```

- Disable `docker` from using `wsl` background feature (might run docker with the `VM` based):

> `C:\Users\<username>\AppData\Roaming\Docker\settings.json` -> Set `wslEngineEnabled` to false.

6. Turn on/off Windows Features from Windows Features:

- Solution1: open path `C:\Windows\System32\OptionalFeatures.exe` -> then tick to whichever features you wished to!

- Solution2: these 3 commands below achieving the same output to list all of these `disabled features` as expected:

```pwsh
Get-WindowsOptionalFeature -Online | Where-Object {$_.State -eq "Disabled"} (without full details)
Get-WindowsOptionalFeature -FeatureName * -Online | Where-Object {$_.State -eq "Disabled"} (full deatails)
Get-WindowsOptionalFeature -OnLine | Where-Object {$_.State -eq "Disabled"} | Out-GridView (output to grid-view)
```

Then you can enable which features as you want to:

```pwsh
Enable-WindowsOptionalFeature -FeatureName "<FeatureName>" -All -Online
```

- Solution3:

```cmd
dism /online /get-features /format:table | find "Disabled"
```

Then you can enable which features as you want to:

```cmd
dism /online /Enable-Feature /FeatureName:"FeatureName" -All
```

- NOTE: with the disable process, you just need to use, eg:

```pwsh
Disable-WindowsOptionalFeature -FeatureName "<Feature>" -Online
dism /online /Disable-Feature /FeatureName:"<Feature>"
```
