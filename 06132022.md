1. `bare` and `non-bare` repository:

- `git clone`: the difference between a `bare` and `non-bare` repo is that a bare repo 
does not have a default remote `origin` repo. 

```git
git clone --bare <remote> <local>
git clone <remote> <local>
```

2. `git set-upstream`:

- Change the default upstream branch to the new one:

```git
git branch --set-upstream-to=origin/<branch> <local_branch>
```

3. `arping`: commonly used in network admins

- If multiple device connected to the Ethernet, system already have an ARP internal table
for communicating over the network. (NOTE: viewing `arp table`)

```bash
arp -a
```

- NOTE: The command will be listed the hostnames, IP, and MAC addresses.

- `arping` ping to the given device has already connected in the network:

```bash
arping -I <device_name> <ipv4>
```

- Show and specify the network interface to `arping`:

```bash 
ip link show 
arping -I <device_name> -c <ping_times> <ipv4>
arping -I <device_name> -c <ping_times> -s <MAC_addr> <ipv4>
arping -I <device_name> -c <ping_times> -S <IP_addr> <ipv4>

```

- Get only the `devices name` that have been associated in the same network interface:
- NOTE: the `sed` command is used to remove the IPv6 address in the stdout with an empty character.

```bash
ip link show | awk '{ print $2 }' | sed -r -e 's/^([^:]+\:){5,}.*$//g'
```
