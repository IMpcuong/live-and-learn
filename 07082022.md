1. `Load Balancer`: minimize the servers downtime to almost zero approximation:

- Idea:

```
-> If one server go down, a load balancer immediately redirects traffic to the remaining healthy server.
-> When a new servers are added to the server pool, a load balancer automatically starts sending request to it.
```

- `ALB` := Layer 7, flexible:

```
-> A distribution has a wide range of variables that was based on network to application layer.
-> A context-aware, can redirect the requests traffic depent on single or combination variables.
-> A load balancing process based on its own behavior (peculiar/particular/individual way), not solely/only based on server (OS, virtualization layer).
-> A Layer 7 so that only accepted/listened the HTTP1-2/HTTPS peculiarly, routing HTTP/HTTPS traffic depent upon rules, host-based/path-based.
-> A list of Target which each one of the member can be on different ports, with a range of health check status codes (like HTTP status code).
```

- `NLB` := Layer 4, static IPs:

```
-> A distribution based on network variables, such as := {IP address, destination ports, etc}
-> A Layer 4 (TCP) and below, can not conceive anything that was coming from applications layer := {content-type, cookie data, header, etc}
-> A context-less application, only care about the network informations contained within the packets transportation.
-> A TCP Load Balancer only that contains some NAT (Network Address Translation) actions at the VPC level (Virtual Private Cloud/Server).
-> A static endpoints method using EIPs (Enterprise Intergration Pattern), each endpoint can locate in different ports.
```

```
-> ALB + NLB: designed from the ground for the modern paradigm of dynamic port configurations as commonly
seen in containerized deployments.
```

- `CLB` := Avoid, legacy -> only suppo rt 200 OK for HTTP health checks.
