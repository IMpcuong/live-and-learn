| Feature             | Interpreter                                          | Compiler                                                          |
| ------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Translation Process | Translates code line by line during runtime          | Translates entire code at once before runtime                     |
| Execution Speed     | Slower due to the need to translate each line        | Faster due to the translation being done beforehand               |
| Error Detection     | Errors are detected after each line is executed      | Errors are detected before the program is executed                |
| Debugging           | Easier due to the ability to debug line by line      | More difficult due to the entire code being translated            |
| Portability         | More portable since it does not require compilation  | Less portable since it requires compilation for a target platform |
| Memory Usage        | Higher due to the need to store intermediate results | Lower due to the compiled code being more optimized               |
| Examples            | Python, Ruby, JavaScript, PHP                        | C/C++, Java, Go, Rust, Swift                                      |
