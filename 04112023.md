0. Configure DNS resolver on Ubuntu machines after rebooting:

```bash
# NOTE: The reboot Ubuntu server operation will revert our latest patches to its archetype configuration.
systemd-resolve --set-dns=1.1.1.1
systemd-resolve --status
systemd-resolve --statistics
# NOTE: Don't use `systemctl restart systemd-resolved.service` -> the "back to the old day" will be happened.
dig any google.com # ;; SERVER: 1.1.1.1#53(1.1.1.1) --> Domain name system now can be resolved by your machine.
```
