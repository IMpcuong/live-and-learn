0. `lvalues` and `rvalues`:

- The first jargon determines a piece of memory which really allocated value, the second one is about a temporary/arbitrary value that wasn't actually stored on the memory at the compile-time yet.

2. Detects IP address for MacOS machine:

```bash
ifconfig en0 | awk '/inet / { print $2; }'
rsync -ravq ~/.ssh/id_rsa user@ip:~/.ssh
# `-r`: Synchronize files recursively.
# `-a`: Archive mode, syncs directories recursively, transfer special block devices, preserve symbolic-links, etc.
# `-vq`: Verbose and also quietly update mode.
