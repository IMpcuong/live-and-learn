0. `lvalues` and `rvalues`:

- The first jargon determines a piece of memory which really allocated value, the second one is about a temporary/arbitrary value that wasn't actually stored on the memory at the compile-time yet.
- A `constant reference (un-modifiable)` in C++ at the end will convert to a pointer value, it's just a syntactic sugar. A pointer's size have a tight-coupling relationship with the CPU's architecture, x64 -> 8 byte pointer.
