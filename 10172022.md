### `Docker in Action, Second Edition`: Starting learning Docker following hands-on instructions:

1. Running software in containers for isolation:

- Docker builds container using 10 major system features:

  | Feature            | Illustration                                  |
  | ------------------ | --------------------------------------------- |
  | `PID namespace`    | Process identifiers and capabilities.         |
  | `UTS namespace`    | Host and domain name.                         |
  | `MNT namespace`    | Filesystem access and structure.              |
  | `IPC namespace`    | Process communication over shared memory.     |
  | `NET namespace`    | Network access and structure.                 |
  | `USR namespace`    | User names and identifiers.                   |
  | `chroot syscall`   | Controls the location of the filesystem root. |
  | `cgroups`          | Resource protection.                          |
  | `CAP drop`         | Operating system feature restrictions.        |
  | `Security modules` | Mandatory access controls.                    |

- Docker use those features as above to build containers at runtime, but it uses another set of technologies to package and ship containers.

- Example:

  ```bash
  # `-d/--detach` := running new container as a background-process, this means that the program started but isn't attached in our terminal.
  docker run --detach --name web nginx:latest

  docker run -d --name mailer dockerinaction/ch2_mailer

  # NOTE: Runnning an interactive containers with the terminal:
  # `-i/--interactive` := Keep the standard-input-stream (`stdin`) open for the container even if no terminal is attached.
  # `-t/--tty` := To allocate a virtual terminal for the container, which will allow users to pass signals to the container.
  # `--link` := Add link to another container.
  docker run -it --link web:web --name web_test busybox:1.29
  # -> Access: `/bin/sh` inside `busybox` container.
  # -> Run this command: `wget -O - http://web:80/` (remember to disable http(s)_proxy || HTTP(S)_PROXY if your Docker configuration have one).
  # NOTE: `wget -O <FILE> <URL>` := Save to <FILE> ('-' for stdout).

  docker run -it --name agent --link web:insideweb --link mailer:insidemailer dockerinaction/ch2_agent
  ```

  - NOTE:
    - Everytime you run `docker run` and creare a new container, that new container will get an unique identifier (blob of characters).
    - Running detached container suitable with programs that sit quietly in the background. That type of program is called as a `daemon`, or a `service`.
    - A `daemon` generally interacts with other programs or humans over a network or some other communication channel.

- List of some basic commands that can easily take effect on a container:

  | Action  | Command                                                                       | Display information                                 |
  | ------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------- |
  | Listing | `docker ps -a`                                                                | - The container ID.                                 |
  |         |                                                                               | - The image used.                                   |
  |         |                                                                               | - The command executed the container.               |
  |         |                                                                               | - The time since the container was created.         |
  |         |                                                                               | - The duration that the container has been running. |

  |         |                                                                               | - The name of the container itself.                 |
