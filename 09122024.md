- Some SQL code snippets to evaluate elaborately the current connection-pool's state of MySQL's server:

  ```sql
  SELECT table_schema, sum((data_length + index_length) / 1024 / 1024) AS MB from information_schema.tables GROUP BY 1;

  SHOW status WHERE `variable_name` = 'Threads_connected';
  SHOW status WHERE `variable_name` = 'Threads_connected' OR `variable_name` = 'Threads_running';
  SELECT * FROM performance_schema.threads t;
  SELECT t.thread_os_id as os_id, t.name, t.processlist_host as host, t.processlist_db as db, t.processlist_state as state, t.connection_type as conn_type, t.processlist_time as alive FROM performance_schema.threads t;

  SHOW VARIABLES LIKE "max_connections";
  SHOW VARIABLES LIKE "max_used_connections";

  SHOW processlist;
  SHOW FULL processlist;
  SELECT * FROM information_schema.processlist p;

  STATUS;
  SHOW SESSION STATUS;
  SHOW GLOBAL STATUS;
  ```
