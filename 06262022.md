1. Kill a specific process in Windows Server:

- Searching for the PID (process ID) that has been occupied by classifying through a port number:

```cmd
netstat -aon | findstr <port>
```

- Then kill it with `taskkill` command:

```cmd
taskkill /F /T /PID <pid>
```

2. Searching for existence package in the `yum` repo list:

- eg: All the packages started with phrase `go` 

```bash
su -c 'yum list go\*'
```

3. Extract specific field from output of `tasklist` in `cmd`:

```cmd
wmic process where caption="python3.9.exe" get ProcessId
```

4. Redirect or assign a `stdout` to variable in `cmd`:

- Solution 1:

```cmd
echo dir /-D > test.txt
set /p something=<test.txt
echo %something%
```

- Solution 2:

```cmd
for /f "tokens=* USEBACKQ" %%i in ('tasklist ^| findstr "explorer"') do set VAR=%%i
```

- NOTE:

> - The `%%i` with the first `%` is used to escape the second one.
> - Use USEBACKQ if you have a string to insert or a long file name, you can use your double quotes without screwing up the command.
