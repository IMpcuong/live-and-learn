1. Kill a specific process in Windows Server:

- Searching for the PID (process ID) that has been occupied by classifying through a port number:

```cmd
netstat -aon | findstr <port>
```

- Then kill it with `taskkill` command:

```cmd
taskkill /F /T /PID <pid>
```

2. Searching for existence package in the `yum` repo list:

- eg: All the packages started with phrase `go` 

```bash
su -c 'yum list go\*'
```

3. Extract specific field from output of `tasklist` in `cmd`:

```cmd
wmic process where caption="python3.9.exe" get ProcessId
```
