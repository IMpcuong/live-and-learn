1. Check which OS in used by your PC:

- Using `platform` lib:

```py
import platform
my_os = platform.system()
print("OS in my system : ",my_os)
```

- Using `sys` module: useful when you want to detect between subsystem and main system in Windows.

```py
import sys
my_os=sys.platform
print("OS in my system : ",my_os)
```
