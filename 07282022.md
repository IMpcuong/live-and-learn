- Purpose: `sudo sh/bash` := if a file is not marked as executable you need to call a `command shell interpreter` to run it.

  + Step1: `sudo sh` := engage into the `sh` interpretion environment -> run `bash/sh` script without provide the execution privilege.
  + Step2: `sudo sh ./something.sh`

  ```bash
  ls -F | grep \*
  ```

  + `-F` ~ `--classify`: append indicator (one of `[*, /, =, >, @, |]`) to entries.
