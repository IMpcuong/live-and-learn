## Windows tips and tricks:

1.  Export `Group Policies` that was applied into your local machine (from your system-admin or by yourself):

- Using `Operating System Group Policy Result tool` as follow.

```batch
gpresult /p
gpresult /v

@REM Or:

gpresult.exe /p
gpresult.exe /v
```

0. Networking basic knowledges learning trail:

- Resources:

  - [The difference between `0.0.0.0`, `127.0.0.1` and `localhost`][1]

- Hosts := `are any devices which sends/receive traffic` over a network (such as any devices that have been connected to the Internet).
  Hosts on a network share the same IP address space.

- IP Address := `the identity of each host`.
  Represents by a numeric sequences, with the length equals with a 32 bits divided to 4 octets (each contains 8 bits := from (00000000, 11111111)).

  Exp: `11111111.11111111.11111111.11111111` (bin) == `255.255.255.255` (dec) == `FF.FF.FF.FF` (hex).

  `11111111 (bin) := 2^8 + 2^7 +...+ 2^0 (dec) = [ Formula: u1 * (q^n-1)/(q-1) ] = 2^0 * (2^8-1)/(2-1) = 255`.

- Network := `is a logical/grouping of hosts which require similar connectivity`. Also this was known as the methodology of transports traffic between hosts (host to host).
  Networks can contain other networks (`subnets`).
  Networks can connect to other networks (`internet`).

- Switches := `forwards data packets between hosts`. A switch sends packets directly to devices/hosts that were located inside the network.
  Switch facilitate communication inside/within a network.
  Switch only sends data to the single device it is intended for.

- Router := `select paths for data packets to cross networks and reach their destination`. A router allows us to join these network together or at least give them access to each other if permitted.
  Router facilitate communication between multiple networks.
  Router can provide a traffic control point (security, filtering, redirecting). Nowaday, more and more switches also provide some of these functions.
  Router can learn which networks they are attached to. These are known as `routes`, a `routing table` is all the networks a router know about.
  Router has an IP address in the networks they are attached to. This IP also going to be each host's way out of their local network also known as `gateway`.
  Router also create the hierarchy in networks.

- Comparision:

  - Router vs Proxy:

  ```
  [Compare between `Proxy` and `Router`]

  |---------------|                           |--------------|                          |----------|
  | Local machine | -----Multiple Ports-----> | Proxy-Server | -----Specific Port-----> | Internet |
  |---------------|                           |--------------|                          |----------|


  |----------------|                             |--------|                             |------------------|
  | Multi-machines | -----Multiple IP-Addr-----> | Router | -----Specific IP-Addr-----> | Internet/Subnets |

  ```

  - Router vs Switch:

  | Definition  | Router                                                   | Switch                                                     |

  | `Routing`   | The process of moving data between networks.             |                                                            |
  |             | A router is a device whose primary purpose is `Routing.` |                                                            |
  | `Switching` |                                                          | The process of moving data within networks.                |
  |             |                                                          | A switch is a device whose primary purpose is `Switching.` |

- All of this knowledges are very much a foundation overview of devices as we know there are many different `Network Devices` such as:

  - Access Points.
  - Firewalls.
  - Load Balancers.
  - Layer 3 Switches.
  - IDS/IPS.
  - Proxies.
  - Virtual Switches.
  - Virtual Routers.
  - Virtual LAN.

  ---> All of these devices are going to perform `Routing` and `Switching`.

1. The OSI Model - The 7 layers:

- Primary purpose of networking as an industry: is to allow two hosts to share data with each other. Networking allows us to automate the data transferation process (data sharing) follows a set of rules.
- The rules for networking are divided into `7 different layers` and those layers are `known as the OSI model`.
- `OSI` stands for: Open Interconnection Model is a framework used to describe the functions of a networking system. The `OSI` model characterises `computing functions` into a universal set of rules and requirements to support interoperability between different products and software.
- In the `OSI` reference model, the communications between a computing system are split into 7 different abstraction layers: `[ Physical, Data Link, Network, Transport, Session, Presentation, Application ]`.
- The hierarchy order based on the descending of abstraction in each layer, the lower the tier was, the higher the abstraction is.

  | Layer's tier | OSI Model Name | Illustration                                                                                                               |
  | :----------: | :------------: | :------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
  |      1       |   `Physical`   | - Definition: the premise of being able to get data from one host to another host.                                         |
  |              |                | The connection can only be established through a physical cable or WI-FI in this layer as well.                            |
  |              |                | We also see some more legacy hardware seen here around hubs and repeaters to transport the data from onbe host to another. |
  |              |                | - Cables: Ethernet / Fibre / WI-FI / Hubs.                                                                                 |
  |              |                | - Transporting Bits: data exists in the form of bits (1's or 0's).                                                         |
  |              |                | `Something` needs to transport those bits between hosts.                                                                   |
  |      2       |  `Data Link`   | - Definition: enables a node to node transfer where data is packaged into frame.                                           |
  |              |                | There is also a level of error correcting that might have occurred at the physical layer.                                  |
  |              |                | This layer is also where we introduce on first see at MAC (Media Access Control) addresses.                                |
  |      3       |   `Network`    | - Definition:                                                                                                              |
