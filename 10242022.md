## 30 days of DevOps journey:

0. Networking basic knowledges learning trail:

- Hosts := `are any devices which sends/receive traffic` over a network (such as any devices that have been connected to the Internet).
  Hosts on a network share the same IP address space.

- IP Address := `the identity of each host`.
  Represents by a numeric sequences, with the length equals with a 32 bits divided to 4 octets (each contains 8 bits := from (00000000, 11111111)).

  Exp: `11111111.11111111.11111111.11111111` (bin) == `255.255.255.255` (dec) == `FF.FF.FF.FF` (hex).

  `11111111 (bin) := 2^8 + 2^7 +...+ 2^0 (dec) = [ Formula: u1 * (q^n-1)/(q-1) ] = 2^0 * (2^8-1)/(2-1) = 255`.

- Network := `is a logical/grouping of hosts which require similar connectivity`. Also this is what transports traffic between hosts.
  Networks can contain other networks (subnets).
  Networks can connect to other networks (internet).

- Switches := `forwards data packets between hosts`. A switch sends packets directly to devices/hosts.
  Switch only sends data to the single device it is intended for.
