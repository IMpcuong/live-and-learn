1. Get/delete currently stored credentials:

```cmd
[cmd]
cmdkey /l
cmdkey /delete:<targetname>
cmdkey /add:<targetname> /user:<username> /pass:<password>
cmdkey /generic:<targetname> /user:<username> /pass:<password>
```

```pwsh
[pwsh]
Install-Module -Name CredentialManager -Scope CurrentUser

New-StoredCredential -Target <targetname> -UserName <username> `
  -Password <password> -Comment "test" `
  -Persist Enterprise/Local Machine
```

NOTE:

- `/add`: normally add to the `Windows Credentials`.
- `/generic`: adding this credentials to the `Generic Credentials`.
- It's all about the `persistence` between our credentials and the session ending after we logged out.

> - `Enterprise` persistence rule will be applied after logoff/reboot >< `Local machine` persist (`local` is the one that will work)

2. `rundll32.exe` can run not only `.exe` executable file, also can run the `.dll` either:

```cmd
rundll32.exe keymgr.dll,KRShowKeyMgr
rundll32.exe sysdm.cpl,EditEnvironmentVariables
```
